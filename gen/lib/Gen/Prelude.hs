-- | An intentionally limited set of prelude exports.
--
-- Please consider long and hard before adding any addtional types exports to
-- this module - they should either be in pervasive use throughout the project
-- or have zero ambiguity. If you ever are forced to disambiguate at any point,
-- it's a bad export.
--
-- Attempt to avoid non-Prelude base exports if possible, unless pervasive
-- and unambiguous.
--
-- Avoid non-base function, operator, or value-level exports.
