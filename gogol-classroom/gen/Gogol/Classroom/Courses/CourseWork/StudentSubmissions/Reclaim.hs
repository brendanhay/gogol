-- Reclaims a student submission on behalf of the student that owns it. Reclaiming a student submission transfers ownership of attached Drive files to the student and updates the submission state. Only the student that owns the requested student submission may call this method, and only for a student submission that has been turned in. This request must be made by the Developer Console project of the <https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849 OAuth client ID> used to create the corresponding course work item. This method returns the following error codes: * @PERMISSION_DENIED@ if the requesting user is not permitted to access the requested course or course work, unsubmit the requested student submission, or for access errors. * @FAILED_PRECONDITION@ if the student submission has not been turned in. * @INVALID_ARGUMENT@ if the request is malformed. * @NOT_FOUND@ if the requested course, course work, or student submission does not exist.
