-- | An ImportJob can be used to create CryptoKeys and CryptoKeyVersions using pre-existing key material, generated outside of Cloud KMS. When an ImportJob is created, Cloud KMS will generate a \"wrapping key\", which is a public\/private key pair. You use the wrapping key to encrypt (also known as wrap) the pre-existing key material to protect it during the import process. The nature of the wrapping key depends on the choice of import/method. When the wrapping key generation is complete, the state will be set to ACTIVE and the public/key can be fetched. The fetched public key can then be used to wrap your pre-existing key material. Once the key material is wrapped, it can be imported into a new CryptoKeyVersion in an existing CryptoKey by calling ImportCryptoKeyVersion. Multiple CryptoKeyVersions can be imported with a single ImportJob. Cloud KMS uses the private key portion of the wrapping key to unwrap the key material. Only Cloud KMS has access to the private key. An ImportJob expires 3 days after it is
-- created. Once expired, Cloud KMS will no longer be able to import or unwrap any key material that was wrapped with the ImportJob\'s public key. For more information, see <https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/importing-a-key Importing a key>.

-- | An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A @Policy@ is a collection of @bindings@. A @binding@ binds one or more @members@, or principals, to a single @role@. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A @role@ is a named list of permissions; each @role@ can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a @binding@ can also specify a @condition@, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to @true@. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the <https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies IAM documentation>. __JSON example:__ { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles\/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike\@example.com\",

Each of the @bindings@ must contain at least one principal. The @bindings@ in a @Policy@ can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the @bindings@ grant 50 different roles to @user:alice\@example.com@, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the @bindings@ in the @Policy@.
