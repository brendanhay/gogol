-- | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
-- global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
-- after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will
-- always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For
-- resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or
-- false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is
-- expected to be found will be included.
atalIncludeAllScopes :: Lens' AcceleratorTypesAggregatedList (Maybe Bool)
atalIncludeAllScopes
  = lens _atalIncludeAllScopes
      (\ s a -> s{_atalIncludeAllScopes = a})

-- | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in
-- case of failure. The default value is false.
atalReturnPartialSuccess :: Lens' AcceleratorTypesAggregatedList (Maybe Bool)
atalReturnPartialSuccess
  = lens _atalReturnPartialSuccess
      (\ s a -> s{_atalReturnPartialSuccess = a})

-- | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned
-- in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort
-- results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using
-- \`orderBy=\"creationTimestamp desc\"\`. This sorts results based on the
-- \`creationTimestamp\` field in reverse chronological order (newest
-- result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
-- newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by \`name\`
-- or \`creationTimestamp desc\` is supported.
atalOrderBy :: Lens' AcceleratorTypesAggregatedList (Maybe Text)
atalOrderBy
  = lens _atalOrderBy (\ s a -> s{_atalOrderBy = a})

-- | Project ID for this request.
atalProject :: Lens' AcceleratorTypesAggregatedList Text
atalProject
  = lens _atalProject (\ s a -> s{_atalProject = a})

-- | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The
-- expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the
-- value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
-- number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either \`=\`,
-- \`!=\`, \`>\`, or \`\<\`. For example, if you are filtering Compute
-- Engine instances, you can exclude instances named \`example-instance\`
-- by specifying \`name != example-instance\`. You can also filter nested
-- fields. For example, you could specify \`scheduling.automaticRestart =
-- false\` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for
-- automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter
-- based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
-- each separate expression within parentheses. For example: \`\`\`
-- (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\")
-- \`\`\` By default, each expression is an \`AND\` expression. However,
-- you can include \`AND\` and \`OR\` expressions explicitly. For example:
-- \`\`\` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel
-- Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) \`\`\`
atalFilter :: Lens' AcceleratorTypesAggregatedList (Maybe Text)
atalFilter
  = lens _atalFilter (\ s a -> s{_atalFilter = a})

-- | Specifies a page token to use. Set \`pageToken\` to the
-- \`nextPageToken\` returned by a previous list request to get the next
-- page of results.
atalPageToken :: Lens' AcceleratorTypesAggregatedList (Maybe Text)
atalPageToken
  = lens _atalPageToken
      (\ s a -> s{_atalPageToken = a})

-- | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the
-- number of available results is larger than \`maxResults\`, Compute
-- Engine returns a \`nextPageToken\` that can be used to get the next page
-- of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are \`0\` to
-- \`500\`, inclusive. (Default: \`500\`)
