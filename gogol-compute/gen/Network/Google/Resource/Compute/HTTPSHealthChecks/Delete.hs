-- | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID
-- so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore
-- the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a
-- situation where you make an initial request and the request times out.
-- If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can
-- check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and
-- if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from
-- accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a
-- valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
-- (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
