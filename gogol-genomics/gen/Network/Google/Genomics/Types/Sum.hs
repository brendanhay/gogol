data ActionFlagsItem
    = FlagUnspecified
      -- ^ @FLAG_UNSPECIFIED@
      -- Unspecified flag.
    | IgnoreExitStatus
      -- ^ @IGNORE_EXIT_STATUS@
      -- Normally, a non-zero exit status causes the pipeline to fail. This flag
      -- allows execution of other actions to continue instead.
    | RunInBackgRound
      -- ^ @RUN_IN_BACKGROUND@
      -- This flag allows an action to continue running in the background while
      -- executing subsequent actions. This is useful to provide services to
      -- other actions (or to provide debugging support tools like SSH servers).
    | AlwaysRun
      -- ^ @ALWAYS_RUN@
      -- By default, after an action fails, no further actions are run. This flag
      -- indicates that this action must be run even if the pipeline has already
      -- failed. This is useful for actions that copy output files off of the VM
      -- or for debugging. Note that no actions will be run if image prefetching
      -- fails.
    | EnableFuse
      -- ^ @ENABLE_FUSE@
      -- Enable access to the FUSE device for this action. Filesystems can then
      -- be mounted into disks shared with other actions. The other actions do
      -- not need the \`ENABLE_FUSE\` flag to access the mounted filesystem. This
      -- has the effect of causing the container to be executed with
      -- \`CAP_SYS_ADMIN\` and exposes \`\/dev\/fuse\` to the container, so use
      -- it only for containers you trust.
    | PublishExposedPorts
      -- ^ @PUBLISH_EXPOSED_PORTS@
      -- Exposes all ports specified by \`EXPOSE\` statements in the container.
      -- To discover the host side port numbers, consult the \`ACTION_STARTED\`
      -- event in the operation metadata.
    | DisableImagePrefetch
      -- ^ @DISABLE_IMAGE_PREFETCH@
      -- All container images are typically downloaded before any actions are
      -- executed. This helps prevent typos in URIs or issues like lack of disk
      -- space from wasting large amounts of compute resources. If set, this flag
      -- prevents the worker from downloading the image until just before the
      -- action is executed.
    | DisableStandardErrorCapture
      -- ^ @DISABLE_STANDARD_ERROR_CAPTURE@
      -- A small portion of the container\'s standard error stream is typically
      -- captured and returned inside the \`ContainerStoppedEvent\`. Setting this
      -- flag disables this functionality.
    | BlockExternalNetwork
      -- ^ @BLOCK_EXTERNAL_NETWORK@
      -- Prevents the container from accessing the external network.

      -- The operation was cancelled, typically by the caller. HTTP Mapping: 499
      -- Client Closed Request
    | Unknown
      -- ^ @UNKNOWN@
      -- Unknown error. For example, this error may be returned when a \`Status\`
      -- value received from another address space belongs to an error space that
      -- is not known in this address space. Also errors raised by APIs that do
      -- not return enough error information may be converted to this error. HTTP
      -- Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error
    | InvalidArgument
      -- ^ @INVALID_ARGUMENT@
      -- The client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from
      -- \`FAILED_PRECONDITION\`. \`INVALID_ARGUMENT\` indicates arguments that
      -- are problematic regardless of the state of the system (e.g., a malformed
      -- file name). HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
    | DeadlineExceeded
      -- ^ @DEADLINE_EXCEEDED@
      -- The deadline expired before the operation could complete. For operations
      -- that change the state of the system, this error may be returned even if
      -- the operation has completed successfully. For example, a successful
      -- response from a server could have been delayed long enough for the
      -- deadline to expire. HTTP Mapping: 504 Gateway Timeout
    | NotFound
      -- ^ @NOT_FOUND@
      -- Some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not found. Note to
      -- server developers: if a request is denied for an entire class of users,
      -- such as gradual feature rollout or undocumented allowlist, \`NOT_FOUND\`
      -- may be used. If a request is denied for some users within a class of
      -- users, such as user-based access control, \`PERMISSION_DENIED\` must be
      -- used. HTTP Mapping: 404 Not Found
    | AlreadyExists
      -- ^ @ALREADY_EXISTS@
      -- The entity that a client attempted to create (e.g., file or directory)
      -- already exists. HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
    | PermissionDenied
      -- ^ @PERMISSION_DENIED@
      -- The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation.
      -- \`PERMISSION_DENIED\` must not be used for rejections caused by
      -- exhausting some resource (use \`RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED\` instead for those
      -- errors). \`PERMISSION_DENIED\` must not be used if the caller can not be
      -- identified (use \`UNAUTHENTICATED\` instead for those errors). This
      -- error code does not imply the request is valid or the requested entity
      -- exists or satisfies other pre-conditions. HTTP Mapping: 403 Forbidden
    | Unauthenticated
      -- ^ @UNAUTHENTICATED@
      -- The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the
      -- operation. HTTP Mapping: 401 Unauthorized
    | ResourceExhausted
      -- ^ @RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED@
      -- Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps
      -- the entire file system is out of space. HTTP Mapping: 429 Too Many
      -- Requests
    | FailedPrecondition
      -- ^ @FAILED_PRECONDITION@
      -- The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required
      -- for the operation\'s execution. For example, the directory to be deleted
      -- is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc.
      -- Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between
      -- \`FAILED_PRECONDITION\`, \`ABORTED\`, and \`UNAVAILABLE\`: (a) Use
      -- \`UNAVAILABLE\` if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use
      -- \`ABORTED\` if the client should retry at a higher level. For example,
      -- when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should
      -- restart a read-modify-write sequence. (c) Use \`FAILED_PRECONDITION\` if
      -- the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly
      -- fixed. For example, if an \"rmdir\" fails because the directory is
      -- non-empty, \`FAILED_PRECONDITION\` should be returned since the client
      -- should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory. HTTP
      -- Mapping: 400 Bad Request
    | Aborted
      -- ^ @ABORTED@
      -- The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue such as
      -- a sequencer check failure or transaction abort. See the guidelines above
      -- for deciding between \`FAILED_PRECONDITION\`, \`ABORTED\`, and
      -- \`UNAVAILABLE\`. HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
    | OutOfRange
      -- ^ @OUT_OF_RANGE@
      -- The operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or
      -- reading past end-of-file. Unlike \`INVALID_ARGUMENT\`, this error
      -- indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes. For
      -- example, a 32-bit file system will generate \`INVALID_ARGUMENT\` if
      -- asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it
      -- will generate \`OUT_OF_RANGE\` if asked to read from an offset past the
      -- current file size. There is a fair bit of overlap between
      -- \`FAILED_PRECONDITION\` and \`OUT_OF_RANGE\`. We recommend using
      -- \`OUT_OF_RANGE\` (the more specific error) when it applies so that
      -- callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for an
      -- \`OUT_OF_RANGE\` error to detect when they are done. HTTP Mapping: 400
      -- Bad Request
    | Unimplemented
      -- ^ @UNIMPLEMENTED@
      -- The operation is not implemented or is not supported\/enabled in this
      -- service. HTTP Mapping: 501 Not Implemented
    | Internal
      -- ^ @INTERNAL@
      -- Internal errors. This means that some invariants expected by the
      -- underlying system have been broken. This error code is reserved for
      -- serious errors. HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error
    | Unavailable
      -- ^ @UNAVAILABLE@
      -- The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a transient
      -- condition, which can be corrected by retrying with a backoff. Note that
      -- it is not always safe to retry non-idempotent operations. See the
      -- guidelines above for deciding between \`FAILED_PRECONDITION\`,
      -- \`ABORTED\`, and \`UNAVAILABLE\`. HTTP Mapping: 503 Service Unavailable
    | DataLoss
      -- ^ @DATA_LOSS@
      -- Unrecoverable data loss or corruption. HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server
