The moving mean is only applicable for data whose values are >= 0. Any values \< 0 are treated as a missing datapoint, and are ignored. While DELTA metrics are accepted by this alignment, special care should be taken that the values for the metric will always be positive. The output is a GAUGE metric with value/type DOUBLE.

This alignment returns ((current - previous)\/previous) * 100, where the value of previous is determined based on the alignment/period.If the values of current and previous are both 0, then the returned value is 0. If only previous is 0, the returned value is infinity.A 10-minute moving mean is computed at each point of the alignment period prior to the above calculation to smooth the metric and prevent false positives from very short-lived spikes. The moving mean is only applicable for data whose values are >= 0. Any values \< 0 are treated as a missing datapoint, and are ignored. While DELTA metrics are accepted by this alignment, special care should be taken that the values for the metric will always be positive. The output is a GAUGE metric with value/type DOUBLE.

-- | An Aligner describes how to bring the data points in a single time series into temporal alignment. Except for ALIGN/NONE, all alignments cause all the data points in an alignment/period to be mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for each alignment/period with end timestamp at the end of the period.Not all alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid choices depend on the metric/kind and value/type of the original time series. Alignment can change the metric/kind or the value/type of the time series.Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time series reduction.

-- | An Aligner describes how to bring the data points in a single time series into temporal alignment. Except for ALIGN/NONE, all alignments cause all the data points in an alignment/period to be mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for each alignment/period with end timestamp at the end of the period.Not all alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid choices depend on the metric/kind and value/type of the original time series. Alignment can change the metric/kind or the value/type of the time series.Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time series reduction.

If only previous is 0, the returned value is infinity.A 10-minute moving mean is computed at each point of the alignment period prior to the above calculation to smooth the metric and prevent false positives from very short-lived spikes. The moving mean is only applicable for data whose values are >= 0. Any values \< 0 are treated as a missing datapoint, and are ignored. While DELTA metrics are accepted by this alignment, special care should be taken that the values for the metric will always be positive. The output is a GAUGE metric with value/type DOUBLE.

-- | An Aligner describes how to bring the data points in a single time series into temporal alignment. Except for ALIGN/NONE, all alignments cause all the data points in an alignment/period to be mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for each alignment/period with end timestamp at the end of the period.Not all alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid choices depend on the metric/kind and value/type of the original time series. Alignment can change the metric/kind or the value/type of the time series.Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time series reduction.

-- | An Aligner describes how to bring the data points in a single time series into temporal alignment. Except for ALIGN/NONE, all alignments cause all the data points in an alignment/period to be mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for each alignment/period with end timestamp at the end of the period.Not all alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid choices depend on the metric/kind and value/type of the original time series. Alignment can change the metric/kind or the value/type of the time series.Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time series reduction. If cross/series/reducer is specified, then per/series/aligner must be specified and not equal to ALIGN/NONE and alignment_period must be specified; otherwise, an error is returned.

-- | Align and convert to a percentage change. This aligner is valid for GAUGE and DELTA metrics with numeric values. This alignment returns ((current - previous)\/previous) * 100, where the value of previous is determined based on the alignment/period.If the values of current and previous are both 0, then the returned value is 0. If only previous is 0, the returned value is infinity.A 10-minute moving mean is computed at each point of the alignment period prior to the above calculation to smooth the metric and prevent false positives from very short-lived spikes. The moving mean is only applicable for data whose values are >= 0. Any values \< 0 are treated as a missing datapoint, and are ignored. While DELTA metrics are accepted by this alignment, special care should be taken that the values for the metric will always be positive. The output is a GAUGE metric with value/type DOUBLE.
