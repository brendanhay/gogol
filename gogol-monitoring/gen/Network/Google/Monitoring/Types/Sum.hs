-- | An Aligner describes how to bring the data points in a single time
-- series into temporal alignment. Except for ALIGN_NONE, all alignments
-- cause all the data points in an alignment_period to be mathematically
-- grouped together, resulting in a single data point for each
-- alignment_period with end timestamp at the end of the period.Not all
-- alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid
-- choices depend on the metric_kind and value_type of the original time
-- series. Alignment can change the metric_kind or the value_type of the
-- time series.Time series data must be aligned in order to perform
-- cross-time series reduction. If cross_series_reducer is specified, then
-- per_series_aligner must be specified and not equal to ALIGN_NONE and
-- alignment_period must be specified; otherwise, an error is returned.

-- alignment_period with end timestamp at the end of the period.Not all
-- alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid
-- choices depend on the metric_kind and value_type of the original time
-- series. Alignment can change the metric_kind or the value_type of the
