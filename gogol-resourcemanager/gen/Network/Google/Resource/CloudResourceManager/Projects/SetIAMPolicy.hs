-- Sets the IAM access control policy for the specified project. CAUTION:
-- This method will replace the existing policy, and cannot be used to
-- append additional IAM settings. Note: Removing service accounts from
-- policies or changing their roles can render services completely
-- inoperable. It is important to understand how the service account is
-- being used before removing or updating its roles. The following
-- constraints apply when using \`setIamPolicy()\`: + Project does not
-- support \`allUsers\` and \`allAuthenticatedUsers\` as \`members\` in a
-- \`Binding\` of a \`Policy\`. + The owner role can be granted to a
-- \`user\`, \`serviceAccount\`, or a group that is part of an
-- organization. For example, group\'myownpersonaldomain.com could be added
-- as an owner to a project in the myownpersonaldomain.com organization,
-- but not the examplepetstore.com organization. + Service accounts can be
-- made owners of a project directly without any restrictions. However, to
-- be added as an owner, a user must be invited using the Cloud Platform
-- console and must accept the invitation. + A user cannot be granted the
-- owner role using \`setIamPolicy()\`. The user must be granted the owner
-- role using the Cloud Platform Console and must explicitly accept the
-- invitation. + Invitations to grant the owner role cannot be sent using
-- \`setIamPolicy()\`; they must be sent only using the Cloud Platform
-- Console. + Membership changes that leave the project without any owners
-- that have accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) will be rejected. + If the
-- project is not part of an organization, there must be at least one owner
-- who has accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement in the policy.
-- Calling \`setIamPolicy()\` to remove the last ToS-accepted owner from
-- the policy will fail. This restriction also applies to legacy projects
-- that no longer have owners who have accepted the ToS. Edits to IAM
-- policies will be rejected until the lack of a ToS-accepting owner is
-- rectified. + Calling this method requires enabling the App Engine Admin
-- API.
