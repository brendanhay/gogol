-- | This message defines the standard attribute vocabulary for Google APIs. An attribute is a piece of metadata that describes an activity on a network service. For example, the size of an HTTP request, or the status code of an HTTP response. Each attribute has a type and a name, which is logically defined as a proto message field in @AttributeContext@. The field type becomes the attribute type, and the field path becomes the attribute name. For example, the attribute @source.ip@ maps to field @AttributeContext.source.ip@. This message definition is guaranteed not to have any wire breaking change. So you can use it directly for passing attributes across different systems. NOTE: Different system may generate different subset of attributes. Please verify the system specification before relying on an attribute generated a system.
