-- Updates an instance, and begins allocating or releasing resources as

-- progress of updating the instance. If the named instance does not exist,
-- returns \`NOT_FOUND\`. Immediately upon completion of this request: *
-- For resource types for which a decrease in the instance\'s allocation
-- has been requested, billing is based on the newly-requested level. Until
-- completion of the returned operation: * Cancelling the operation sets
-- its metadata\'s cancel_time, and begins restoring resources to their
-- pre-request values. The operation is guaranteed to succeed at undoing
-- all resource changes, after which point it terminates with a
-- \`CANCELLED\` status. * All other attempts to modify the instance are
-- rejected. * Reading the instance via the API continues to give the
-- pre-request resource levels. Upon completion of the returned operation:
-- * Billing begins for all successfully-allocated resources (some types
-- may have lower than the requested levels). * All newly-reserved
-- resources are available for serving the instance\'s tables. * The
-- instance\'s new resource levels are readable via the API. The returned
-- long-running operation will have a name of the format \`\/operations\/\`
-- and can be used to track the instance modification. The metadata field
-- type is UpdateInstanceMetadata. The response field type is Instance, if
-- successful. Authorization requires \`spanner.instances.update\`
-- permission on resource name.
