-- | An HttpData resource specifies a list of objects on the web to be transferred over HTTP. The information of the objects to be transferred is contained in a file referenced by a URL. The first line in the file must be @\"TsvHttpData-1.0\"@, which specifies the format of the file. Subsequent lines specify the information of the list of objects, one object per list entry. Each entry has the following tab-delimited fields: * __HTTP URL__ — The location of the object. * __Length__ — The size of the object in bytes. * __MD5__ — The base64-encoded MD5 hash of the object. For an example of a valid TSV file, see <https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/create-url-list Transferring data from URLs>. When transferring data based on a URL list, keep the following in mind: * When an object located at @http(s):\/\/hostname:port\/@ is transferred to a data sink, the name of the object at the data sink is @\/@. * If the specified size of an object does not match the actual size of the object fetched, the object is not
-- transferred. * If the specified MD5 does not match the MD5 computed from the transferred bytes, the object transfer fails. * Ensure that each URL you specify is publicly accessible. For example, in Cloud Storage you can [share an object publicly] (\/storage\/docs\/cloud-console#_sharingdata) and get a link to it. * Storage Transfer Service obeys @robots.txt@ rules and requires the source HTTP server to support @Range@ requests and to return a @Content-Length@ header in each response. * ObjectConditions have no effect when filtering objects to transfer.
