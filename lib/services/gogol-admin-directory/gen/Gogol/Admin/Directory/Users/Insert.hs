-- Creates a user. Mutate calls immediately following user creation might sometimes fail as the user isn\'t fully created due to propagation delay in our backends. Check the error details for the \"User creation is not complete\" message to see if this is the case. Retrying the calls after some time can help in this case. If @resolveConflictAccount@ is set to @true@, a @202@ response code means that a conflicting unmanaged account exists and was invited to join the organization. A @409@ response code means that a conflicting account exists so the user wasn\'t created based on the <https://support.google.com/a/answer/11112794 handling unmanaged user accounts> option selected.
