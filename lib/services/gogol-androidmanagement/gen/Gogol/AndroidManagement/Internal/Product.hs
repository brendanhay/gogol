However for unusual configurations like general internal filtering a global HTTP proxy may be useful. If the proxy is not accessible, network access may break. The global proxy is only a recommendation and some apps may ignore it.
    recommendedGlobalProxy :: (Core.Maybe ProxyInfo),
    -- | Whether removing other users is disabled.

    shortSupportMessage :: (Core.Maybe UserFacingMessage),
    -- | Flag to skip hints on the first use. Enterprise admin can enable the system recommendation for apps to skip their user tutorial and other introductory hints on first start-up.
    skipFirstUseHintsEnabled :: (Core.Maybe Core.Bool),
    -- | Whether sending and receiving SMS messages is disabled.
    smsDisabled :: (Core.Maybe Core.Bool),
    -- | Whether the status bar is disabled. This disables notifications, quick settings, and other screen overlays that allow escape from full-screen mode. DEPRECATED. To disable the status bar on a kiosk device, use InstallType KIOSK or kioskCustomLauncherEnabled.
    statusBarDisabled :: (Core.Maybe Core.Bool),
    -- | Status reporting settings
    statusReportingSettings :: (Core.Maybe StatusReportingSettings),
    -- | The battery plugged in modes for which the device stays on. When using this setting, it is recommended to clear maximum/time/to_lock so that the device doesn\'t lock itself while it stays on.
    stayOnPluggedModes :: (Core.Maybe [Policy_StayOnPluggedModesItem]),
    -- | The system update policy, which controls how OS updates are applied. If the update type is WINDOWED, the update window will automatically apply to Play app updates as well.

    uninstallAppsDisabled :: (Core.Maybe Core.Bool),
    -- | If microphone/access is set to any value other than MICROPHONE/ACCESS_UNSPECIFIED, this has no effect. Otherwise this field controls whether microphones are disabled: If true, all microphones are disabled, otherwise they are available. This is available only on fully managed devices.
    unmuteMicrophoneDisabled :: (Core.Maybe Core.Bool),
    -- | Configuration of device activity logging.
    usageLog :: (Core.Maybe UsageLog),
    -- | Whether transferring files over USB is disabled. This is supported only on company-owned devices.
    usbFileTransferDisabled :: (Core.Maybe Core.Bool),
    -- | Whether USB storage is enabled. Deprecated.
    usbMassStorageEnabled :: (Core.Maybe Core.Bool),
    -- | The version of the policy. This is a read-only field. The version is incremented each time the policy is updated.
    version :: (Core.Maybe Core.Int64),
    -- | Whether configuring VPN is disabled.
    vpnConfigDisabled :: (Core.Maybe Core.Bool),
    -- | Whether configuring Wi-Fi access points is disabled. Note: If a network connection can\'t be made at boot time and configuring Wi-Fi is disabled then network escape hatch will be shown in order to refresh the device policy (see networkEscapeHatchEnabled).
