-- Suspends an active subscription. You can use this method to suspend a paid subscription that is currently in the @ACTIVE@ state. * For @FLEXIBLE@ subscriptions, billing is paused. * For @ANNUAL_MONTHLY_PAY@ or @ANNUAL_YEARLY_PAY@ subscriptions: * Suspending the subscription does not change the renewal date that was originally committed to. * A suspended subscription does not renew. If you activate the subscription after the original renewal date, a new annual subscription will be created, starting on the day of activation. We strongly encourage you to suspend subscriptions only for short periods of time as suspensions over 60 days may result in the subscription being cancelled.
