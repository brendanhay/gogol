data ChatSpacesMembersList = ChatSpacesMembersList
  { -- | V1 error format.
    xgafv :: (Core.Maybe Xgafv),
    -- | OAuth access token.
    accessToken :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | JSONP
    callback :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Optional. A query filter. You can filter memberships by a member\'s role (<https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.members#membershiprole role>) and type (<https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/User#type member.type>). To filter by role, set @role@ to @ROLE_MEMBER@ or @ROLE_MANAGER@. To filter by type, set @member.type@ to @HUMAN@ or @BOT@. You can also filter for @member.type@ using the @!=@ operator. To filter by both role and type, use the @AND@ operator. To filter by either role or type, use the @OR@ operator. Either @member.type = \"HUMAN\"@ or @member.type != \"BOT\"@ is required when @use_admin_access@ is set to true. Other member type filters will be rejected. For example, the following queries are valid: @role = \"ROLE_MANAGER\" OR role = \"ROLE_MEMBER\" member.type = \"HUMAN\" AND role = \"ROLE_MANAGER\" member.type != \"BOT\"@ The following queries are invalid:
    -- @member.type = \"HUMAN\" AND member.type = \"BOT\" role = \"ROLE_MANAGER\" AND role = \"ROLE_MEMBER\"@ Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an @INVALID_ARGUMENT@ error.
    filter :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Optional. The maximum number of memberships to return. The service might return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 100 memberships are returned. The maximum value is 1000. If you use a value more than 1000, it\'s automatically changed to 1000. Negative values return an @INVALID_ARGUMENT@ error.
    pageSize :: (Core.Maybe Core.Int32),
    -- | Optional. A page token, received from a previous call to list memberships. Provide this parameter to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided should match the call that provided the page token. Passing different values to the other parameters might lead to unexpected results.
    pageToken :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Required. The resource name of the space for which to fetch a membership list. Format: spaces\/{space}
    parent :: Core.Text,
    -- | Optional. When @true@, also returns memberships associated with a Google Group, in addition to other types of memberships. If a filter is set, Google Group memberships that don\'t match the filter criteria aren\'t returned.
    showGroups :: (Core.Maybe Core.Bool),
    -- | Optional. When @true@, also returns memberships associated with invited members, in addition to other types of memberships. If a filter is set, invited memberships that don\'t match the filter criteria aren\'t returned. Currently requires <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user user authentication>.
    showInvited :: (Core.Maybe Core.Bool),
    -- | Legacy upload protocol for media (e.g. \"media\", \"multipart\").
    uploadType :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Upload protocol for media (e.g. \"raw\", \"multipart\").
    uploadProtocol :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Optional. When @true@, the method runs using the user\'s Google Workspace administrator privileges. The calling user must be a Google Workspace administrator with the <https://support.google.com/a/answer/13369245 manage chat and spaces conversations privilege>. Requires either the @chat.admin.memberships.readonly@ or @chat.admin.memberships@ <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize#chat-api-scopes OAuth 2.0 scope>. Listing app memberships in a space isn\'t supported when using admin access.
