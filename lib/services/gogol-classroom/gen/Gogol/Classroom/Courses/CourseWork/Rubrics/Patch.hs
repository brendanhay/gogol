-- Updates a rubric. See google.classroom.v1.Rubric for details of which fields can be updated. Rubric update capabilities are </classroom/rubrics/limitations limited> once grading has started. The requesting user and course owner must have rubrics creation capabilities. For details, see <https://developers.google.com/classroom/rubrics/limitations#license-requirements licensing requirements>. This request must be made by the Google Cloud console of the <https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849 OAuth client ID> used to create the parent course work item. This method returns the following error codes: * @PERMISSION_DENIED@ if the requesting developer project didn\'t create the corresponding course work, if the user isn\'t permitted to make the requested modification to the rubric, or for access errors. This error code is also returned if grading has already started on the rubric. * @INVALID_ARGUMENT@ if the request is malformed and for the following request error: * @RubricCriteriaInvalidFormat@ *
-- @NOT_FOUND@ if the requested course, course work, or rubric doesn\'t exist or if the user doesn\'t have access to the corresponding course work. * @INTERNAL@ if grading has already started on the rubric.

There are multiple options to define the criteria of a rubric: the @source_spreadsheet_id@ and the @criteria@ list. Only one of these can be used at a time to define a rubric. The rubric @criteria@ list is fully replaced by the rubric criteria specified in the update request. For example, if a criterion or level is missing from the request, it is deleted. New criteria and levels are added and an ID is assigned. Existing criteria and levels retain the previously assigned ID if the ID is specified in the request. The following fields can be specified by teachers: * @criteria@ * @source_spreadsheet_id@
