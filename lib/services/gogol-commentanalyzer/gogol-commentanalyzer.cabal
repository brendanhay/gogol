description:
    The Perspective Comment Analyzer API provides information about the
    potential impact of a comment on a conversation (e.g. it can provide a
    score for the \"toxicity\" of a comment). Users can leverage the
    \"SuggestCommentScore\" method to submit corrections to improve
    Perspective over time. Users can set the \"doNotStore\" flag to ensure
    that all submitted comments are automatically deleted after scores are
    returned.
    .
    /Warning:/ This is an experimental prototype/preview release which is still
    under exploratory development and not intended for public use, caveat emptor!
    .
    This library is compatible with version @v1alpha1@
    of the API.
