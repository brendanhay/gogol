    accessToken :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | JSONP
    callback :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either @=@, @!=@, @>@, @\<@, @\<=@, @>=@ or @:@. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named @example-instance@ by specifying @name != example-instance@. The @:*@ comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with @owner@ label use: @labels.owner:*@ You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify @scheduling.automaticRestart = false@ to include instances only if they are not scheduled for
    -- automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: @(scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\")@ By default, each expression is an @AND@ expression. However, you can include @AND@ and @OR@ expressions explicitly. For example: @(cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)@ If you want to use a regular expression, use the @eq@ (equal) or @ne@ (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: @fieldname eq unquoted literal@ @fieldname eq \'single quoted literal\'@ @fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"@ @(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")@ The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the
    -- entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use @name ne .*instance@. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions.
    filter :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than @maxResults@, Compute Engine returns a @nextPageToken@ that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are @0@ to @500@, inclusive. (Default: @500@)

    -- | The name of the network endpoint group from which you want to generate a list of included network endpoints. It should comply with RFC1035.
    networkEndpointGroup :: Core.Text,
    -- | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using @orderBy=\"creationTimestamp desc\"@. This sorts results based on the @creationTimestamp@ field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by @name@ or @creationTimestamp desc@ is supported.
    orderBy :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Specifies a page token to use. Set @pageToken@ to the @nextPageToken@ returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.

    region :: Core.Text,
    -- | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code.
