-- Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as @DONE@ or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the specified Operation resource. This method waits for no more than the 2 minutes and then returns the current state of the operation, which might be @DONE@ or still in progress. This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically: - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero seconds. - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry if the operation is not @DONE@.
