    accessToken :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | JSONP
    callback :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Bodies of items (files\/documents) to which the query applies. Supported bodies are \'user\', \'domain\', \'drive\', and \'allDrives\'. Prefer \'user\' or \'drive\' to \'allDrives\' for efficiency. By default, corpora is set to \'user\'. However, this can change depending on the filter set through the \'q\' parameter.
    corpora :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Deprecated: The source of files to list. Use \'corpora\' instead.
    corpus :: (Core.Maybe FilesListCorpus),
    -- | ID of the shared drive to search.
    driveId :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Whether both My Drive and shared drive items should be included in results.
    includeItemsFromAllDrives :: Core.Bool,
    -- | A comma-separated list of IDs of labels to include in the @labelInfo@ part of the response.
    includeLabels :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Specifies which additional view\'s permissions to include in the response. Only \'published\' is supported.
    includePermissionsForView :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Deprecated: Use @includeItemsFromAllDrives@ instead.
    includeTeamDriveItems :: Core.Bool,
    -- | A comma-separated list of sort keys. Valid keys are: * @createdTime@: When the file was created. * @folder@: The folder ID. This field is sorted using alphabetical ordering. * @modifiedByMeTime@: The last time the file was modified by the user. * @modifiedTime@: The last time the file was modified by anyone. * @name@: The name of the file. This field is sorted using alphabetical ordering, so 1, 12, 2, 22. * @name_natural@: The name of the file. This field is sorted using natural sort ordering, so 1, 2, 12, 22. * @quotaBytesUsed@: The number of storage quota bytes used by the file. * @recency@: The most recent timestamp from the file\'s date-time fields. * @sharedWithMeTime@: When the file was shared with the user, if applicable. * @starred@: Whether the user has starred the file. * @viewedByMeTime@: The last time the file was viewed by the user. Each key sorts ascending by default, but can be reversed with the \'desc\' modifier. Example usage: @?orderBy=folder,modifiedTime desc,name@.

    -- | The token for continuing a previous list request on the next page. This should be set to the value of \'nextPageToken\' from the previous response.
    pageToken :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | A query for filtering the file results. See the \"Search for files & folders\" guide for supported syntax.
    q :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | A comma-separated list of spaces to query within the corpora. Supported values are \'drive\' and \'appDataFolder\'.
