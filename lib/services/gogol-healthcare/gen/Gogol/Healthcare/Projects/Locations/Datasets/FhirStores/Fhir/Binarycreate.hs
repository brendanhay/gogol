-- Creates a FHIR Binary resource. This method can be used to create a Binary resource either by using one of the accepted FHIR JSON content types, or as a raw data stream. If a resource is created with this method using the FHIR content type this method\'s behavior is the same as <https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.datasets.fhirStores.fhir/create fhir.create>. If a resource type other than Binary is used in the request it\'s treated in the same way as non-FHIR data (e.g., images, zip archives, pdf files, documents). When a non-FHIR content type is used in the request, a Binary resource will be generated, and the uploaded data will be stored in the @content@ field (@DSTU2@ and @STU3@), or the @data@ field (@R4@). The Binary resource\'s @contentType@ will be filled in using the value of the @Content-Type@ header, and the @securityContext@ field (not present in @DSTU2@) will be populated from the @X-Security-Context@ header if it exists. At this time @securityContext@
-- has no special behavior in the Cloud Healthcare API. Note: the limit on data ingested through this method is 1 GB. For best performance, use a non-FHIR data type instead of wrapping the data in a Binary resource. Some of the Healthcare API features, such as <https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/how-tos/fhir-export-bigquery exporting to BigQuery> or <https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/fhir-pubsub#behavior_when_a_fhir_resource_is_too_large_or_traffic_is_high Pub\/Sub notifications> with full resource content, do not support Binary resources that are larger than 10 MB. In these cases the resource\'s @data@ field will be omitted. Instead, the \"http:\/\/hl7.org\/fhir\/StructureDefinition\/data-absent-reason\" extension will be present to indicate that including the data is @unsupported@. On success, an empty @201 Created@ response is returned. The newly created resource\'s ID and version are returned in the Location header. Using @Prefer: representation=resource@ is not allowed for this method.
