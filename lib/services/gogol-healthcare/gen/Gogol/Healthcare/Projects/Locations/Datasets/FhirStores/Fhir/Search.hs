-- Searches for resources in the given FHIR store according to criteria specified as query parameters. Implements the FHIR standard search interaction (<http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#search DSTU2>, <http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#search STU3>, <http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#search R4>) using the search semantics described in the FHIR Search specification (<http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/search.html DSTU2>, <http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/search.html STU3>, <http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/search.html R4>). Supports four methods of search defined by the specification: * @GET [base]?[parameters]@ to search across all resources. * @GET [base]\/[type]?[parameters]@ to search resources of a specified type. * @POST [base]\/_search?[parameters]@ as an alternate form having the same semantics as the @GET@ method across all resources. * @POST [base]\/[type]\/_search?[parameters]@ as an alternate form having
-- the same semantics as the @GET@ method for the specified type. The @GET@ and @POST@ methods do not support compartment searches. The @POST@ method does not support @application\/x-www-form-urlencoded@ search parameters. On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of a @Bundle@ resource of type @searchset@, containing the results of the search. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded @OperationOutcome@ resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. The server\'s capability statement, retrieved through capabilities, indicates what search parameters are supported on each FHIR resource. A list of all search parameters defined by the specification can be found in the FHIR Search Parameter Registry (<http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/searchparameter-registry.html STU3>,
-- <http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/searchparameter-registry.html R4>). FHIR search parameters for DSTU2 can be found on each resource\'s definition page. Supported search modifiers: @:missing@, @:exact@, @:contains@, @:text@, @:in@, @:not-in@, @:above@, @:below@, @:[type]@, @:not@, and @recurse@ (DSTU2 and STU3) or @:iterate@ (R4). Supported search result parameters: @_sort@, @_count@, @_include@, @_revinclude@, @_summary=text@, @_summary=data@, and @_elements@. The maximum number of search results returned defaults to 100, which can be overridden by the @_count@ parameter up to a maximum limit of 1000. The server might return fewer resources than requested to prevent excessively large responses. If there are additional results, the returned @Bundle@ contains a link of @relation@ \"next\", which has a @_page_token@ parameter for an opaque pagination token that can be used to retrieve the next page. Resources with a total size larger than 5MB or a field count larger than 50,000 might not be fully
-- searchable as the server might trim its generated search index in those cases. Note: FHIR resources are indexed asynchronously, so there might be a slight delay between the time a resource is created or changed, and the time when the change reflects in search results. The only exception is resource identifier data, which is indexed synchronously as a special index. As a result, searching using resource identifier is not subject to indexing delay. To use the special synchronous index, the search term for identifier should be in the pattern @identifier=[system]|[value]@ or @identifier=[value]@, and any of the following search result parameters can be used: * @_count@ * @_include@ * @_revinclude@ * @_summary@ * @_elements@ If your query contains any other search parameters, the standard asynchronous index will be used instead. Note that searching against the special index is optimized for resolving a small number of matches. The search isn\'t optimized if your identifier search criteria matches a large number
-- (i.e. more than 2,000) of resources. For a search query that will match a large number of resources, you can avoiding using the special synchronous index by including an additional @_sort@ parameter in your query. Use @_sort=-_lastUpdated@ if you want to keep the default sorting order. Note: The special synchronous identifier index are currently disabled for DocumentReference and DocumentManifest searches.
