-- Deletes a WorkloadIdentityPool. You cannot use a deleted pool to exchange external credentials for Google Cloud credentials. However, deletion does not revoke credentials that have already been issued. Credentials issued for a deleted pool do not grant access to resources. If the pool is undeleted, and the credentials are not expired, they grant access again. You can undelete a pool for 30 days. After 30 days, deletion is permanent. You cannot update deleted pools. However, you can view and list them.
