-- | BucketOptions describes the bucket boundaries used to create a histogram for the distribution. The buckets can be in a linear sequence, an exponential sequence, or each bucket can be specified explicitly. BucketOptions does not include the number of values in each bucket.A bucket has an inclusive lower bound and exclusive upper bound for the values that are counted for that bucket. The upper bound of a bucket must be strictly greater than the lower bound. The sequence of N buckets for a distribution consists of an underflow bucket (number 0), zero or more finite buckets (number 1 through N - 2) and an overflow bucket (number N - 1). The buckets are contiguous: the lower bound of bucket i (i > 0) is the same as the upper bound of bucket i - 1. The buckets span the whole range of finite values: lower bound of the underflow bucket is -infinity and the upper bound of the overflow bucket is +infinity. The finite buckets are so-called because both bounds are finite.

    httpRequest :: (Core.Maybe HttpRequest),
    -- | Optional. A unique identifier for the log entry. If you provide a value, then Logging considers other log entries in the same project, with the same timestamp, and with the same insert/id to be duplicates which are removed in a single query result. However, there are no guarantees of de-duplication in the export of logs.If the insert/id is omitted when writing a log entry, the Logging API assigns its own unique identifier in this field.In queries, the insert/id is also used to order log entries that have the same log/name and timestamp values.
    insertId :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | The log entry payload, represented as a structure that is expressed as a JSON object.
    jsonPayload :: (Core.Maybe LogEntry_JsonPayload),
    -- | Optional. A map of key, value pairs that provides additional information about the log entry. The labels can be user-defined or system-defined.User-defined labels are arbitrary key, value pairs that you can use to classify logs.System-defined labels are defined by GCP services for platform logs. They have two components - a service namespace component and the attribute name. For example: compute.googleapis.com\/resource_name.Cloud Logging truncates label keys that exceed 512 B and label values that exceed 64 KB upon their associated log entry being written. The truncation is indicated by an ellipsis at the end of the character string.
    labels :: (Core.Maybe LogEntry_Labels),
    -- | Required. The resource name of the log to which this log entry belongs: \"projects\/[PROJECT/ID]\/logs\/[LOG/ID]\" \"organizations\/[ORGANIZATION/ID]\/logs\/[LOG/ID]\" \"billingAccounts\/[BILLING/ACCOUNT/ID]\/logs\/[LOG/ID]\" \"folders\/[FOLDER/ID]\/logs\/[LOG/ID]\" A project number may be used in place of PROJECT/ID. The project number is translated to its corresponding PROJECT/ID internally and the log/name field will contain PROJECT/ID in queries and exports.[LOG/ID] must be URL-encoded within log/name. Example: \"organizations\/1234567890\/logs\/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Factivity\".[LOG/ID] must be less than 512 characters long and can only include the following characters: upper and lower case alphanumeric characters, forward-slash, underscore, hyphen, and period.For backward compatibility, if log_name begins with a forward-slash, such as \/projects\/..., then the log entry is ingested as usual, but the forward-slash is removed. Listing the log entry will not show the leading slash and
    -- filtering for a log name with a leading slash will never return any results.
    logName :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Output only. Deprecated. This field is not used by Logging. Any value written to it is cleared.
    metadata :: (Core.Maybe MonitoredResourceMetadata),
    -- | Optional. Information about an operation associated with the log entry, if applicable.
    operation :: (Core.Maybe LogEntryOperation),
    -- | The log entry payload, represented as a protocol buffer. Some Google Cloud Platform services use this field for their log entry payloads.The following protocol buffer types are supported; user-defined types are not supported:\"type.googleapis.com\/google.cloud.audit.AuditLog\" \"type.googleapis.com\/google.appengine.logging.v1.RequestLog\"
    protoPayload :: (Core.Maybe LogEntry_ProtoPayload),
    -- | Output only. The time the log entry was received by Logging.
    receiveTimestamp :: (Core.Maybe Core.DateTime),
    -- | Required. The monitored resource that produced this log entry.Example: a log entry that reports a database error would be associated with the monitored resource designating the particular database that reported the error.
    resource :: (Core.Maybe MonitoredResource),
    -- | Optional. The severity of the log entry. The default value is LogSeverity.DEFAULT.
    severity :: (Core.Maybe LogEntry_Severity),
    -- | Optional. Source code location information associated with the log entry, if any.
    sourceLocation :: (Core.Maybe LogEntrySourceLocation),
    -- | Optional. The ID of the Cloud Trace (https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/trace) span associated with the current operation in which the log is being written. For example, if a span has the REST resource name of \"projects\/some-project\/traces\/some-trace\/spans\/some-span-id\", then the span_id field is \"some-span-id\".A Span (https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/trace\/docs\/reference\/v2\/rest\/v2\/projects.traces\/batchWrite#Span) represents a single operation within a trace. Whereas a trace may involve multiple different microservices running on multiple different machines, a span generally corresponds to a single logical operation being performed in a single instance of a microservice on one specific machine. Spans are the nodes within the tree that is a trace.Applications that are instrumented for tracing (https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/trace\/docs\/setup) will generally assign a new, unique span ID on each incoming request. It is also common to create and record additional spans corresponding to internal processing
    -- elements as well as issuing requests to dependencies.The span ID is expected to be a 16-character, hexadecimal encoding of an 8-byte array and should not be zero. It should be unique within the trace and should, ideally, be generated in a manner that is uniformly random.Example values: 000000000000004a 7a2190356c3fc94b 0000f00300090021 d39223e101960076
    spanId :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Optional. Information indicating this LogEntry is part of a sequence of multiple log entries split from a single LogEntry.
    split :: (Core.Maybe LogSplit),
    -- | The log entry payload, represented as a Unicode string (UTF-8).
    textPayload :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Optional. The time the event described by the log entry occurred. This time is used to compute the log entry\'s age and to enforce the logs retention period. If this field is omitted in a new log entry, then Logging assigns it the current time. Timestamps have nanosecond accuracy, but trailing zeros in the fractional seconds might be omitted when the timestamp is displayed.Incoming log entries must have timestamps that don\'t exceed the logs retention period (https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/logging\/quotas#logs/retention/periods) in the past, and that don\'t exceed 24 hours in the future. Log entries outside those time boundaries aren\'t ingested by Logging.
    timestamp :: (Core.Maybe Core.DateTime),
    -- | Optional. The REST resource name of the trace being written to Cloud Trace (https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/trace) in association with this log entry. For example, if your trace data is stored in the Cloud project \"my-trace-project\" and if the service that is creating the log entry receives a trace header that includes the trace ID \"12345\", then the service should use \"projects\/my-tracing-project\/traces\/12345\".The trace field provides the link between logs and traces. By using this field, you can navigate from a log entry to a trace.
    trace :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Optional. The sampling decision of the trace associated with the log entry.True means that the trace resource name in the trace field was sampled for storage in a trace backend. False means that the trace was not sampled for storage when this log entry was written, or the sampling decision was unknown at the time. A non-sampled trace value is still useful as a request correlation identifier. The default is False.

    filter :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Optional. A map from a label key string to an extractor expression which is used to extract data from a log entry field and assign as the label value. Each label key specified in the LabelDescriptor must have an associated extractor expression in this map. The syntax of the extractor expression is the same as for the value_extractor field.The extracted value is converted to the type defined in the label descriptor. If either the extraction or the type conversion fails, the label will have a default value. The default value for a string label is an empty string, for an integer label its 0, and for a boolean label its false.Note that there are upper bounds on the maximum number of labels and the number of active time series that are allowed in a project.
    labelExtractors :: (Core.Maybe LogMetric_LabelExtractors),
    -- | Optional. The metric descriptor associated with the logs-based metric. If unspecified, it uses a default metric descriptor with a DELTA metric kind, INT64 value type, with no labels and a unit of \"1\". Such a metric counts the number of log entries matching the filter expression.The name, type, and description fields in the metric/descriptor are output only, and is constructed using the name and description field in the LogMetric.To create a logs-based metric that records a distribution of log values, a DELTA metric kind with a DISTRIBUTION value type must be used along with a value/extractor expression in the LogMetric.Each label in the metric descriptor must have a matching label name as the key and an extractor expression as the value in the label/extractors map.The metric/kind and value/type fields in the metric/descriptor cannot be updated once initially configured. New labels can be added in the metric_descriptor, but existing labels cannot be modified except for their description.
    metricDescriptor :: (Core.Maybe MetricDescriptor),
    -- | Required. The client-assigned metric identifier. Examples: \"error/count\", \"nginx\/requests\".Metric identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and the special characters /-.,+!*\',()%\/. The forward-slash character (\/) denotes a hierarchy of name pieces, and it cannot be the first character of the name.This field is the [METRIC/ID] part of a metric resource name in the format \"projects\/PROJECT/ID\/metrics\/METRIC_ID\". Example: If the resource name of a metric is \"projects\/my-project\/metrics\/nginx%2Frequests\", this field\'s value is \"nginx\/requests\".
    name :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Output only. The last update timestamp of the metric.This field may not be present for older metrics.
    updateTime :: (Core.Maybe Core.DateTime),
    -- | Optional. A value/extractor is required when using a distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to record from a log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction: EXTRACT(field) or REGEXP/EXTRACT(field, regex). The arguments are: field: The name of the log entry field from which the value is to be extracted. regex: A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax (https:\/\/github.com\/google\/re2\/wiki\/Syntax) with a single capture group to extract data from the specified log entry field. The value of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex. It is an error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one capture group.The result of the extraction must be convertible to a double type, as the distribution always records double values. If either the extraction or the conversion to double fails, then those values are not recorded in the distribution.Example: REGEXP_EXTRACT(jsonPayload.request, \"./quantity=(\\d+)./\")

However, if the unit is kBy, then the value of the metric is always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it might be displayed.If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently 1s{CPU} or just s). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as 12005.Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular way, you can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value 12.005 (which is 12005\/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which is 12005\/1024).The supported units
    -- are a subset of The Unified Code for Units of Measure (https:\/\/unitsofmeasure.org\/ucum.html) standard:Basic units (UNIT) bit bit By byte s second min minute h hour d day 1 dimensionlessPrefixes (PREFIX) k kilo (10^3) M mega (10^6) G giga (10^9) T tera (10^12) P peta (10^15) E exa (10^18) Z zetta (10^21) Y yotta (10^24) m milli (10^-3) u micro (10^-6) n nano (10^-9) p pico (10^-12) f femto (10^-15) a atto (10^-18) z zepto (10^-21) y yocto (10^-24) Ki kibi (2^10) Mi mebi (2^20) Gi gibi (2^30) Ti tebi (2^40) Pi pebi (2^50)GrammarThe grammar also includes these connectors: \/ division or ratio (as an infix operator). For examples, kBy\/{email} or MiBy\/10ms (although you should almost never have \/s in a metric unit; rates should always be computed at query time from the underlying cumulative or delta value). . multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For examples, GBy.d or k{watt}.h.The grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression = Component { \".\" Component } { \"\/\" Component } ; Component =
    -- ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | \"%\" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | \"1\" ; Annotation = \"{\" NAME \"}\" ; Notes: Annotation is just a comment if it follows a UNIT. If the annotation is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to 1. For examples, {request}\/s == 1\/s, By{transmitted}\/s == By\/s. NAME is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not containing { or }. 1 represents a unitary dimensionless unit (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dimensionless/quantity) of 1, such as in 1\/s. It is typically used when none of the basic units are appropriate. For example, \"new users per day\" can be represented as 1\/d or {new-users}\/d (and a metric value 5 would mean \"5 new users). Alternatively, \"thousands of page views per day\" would be represented as 1000\/d or k1\/d or k{page_views}\/d (and a metric value of 5.3 would mean \"5300 page views per day\"). % represents dimensionless value of 1\/100, and annotates values giving a percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of 0..100, and a
    -- metric value 3 means \"3 percent\"). 10^2.% indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range 0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage (so a metric value 0.03 means \"3 percent\").

-- | The parameters to WriteLogEntries.
--
-- /See:/ 'newWriteLogEntriesRequest' smart constructor.
data WriteLogEntriesRequest = WriteLogEntriesRequest
  { -- | Optional. If true, the request should expect normal response, but the entries won\'t be persisted nor exported. Useful for checking whether the logging API endpoints are working properly before sending valuable data.
    dryRun :: (Core.Maybe Core.Bool),
    -- | Required. The log entries to send to Logging. The order of log entries in this list does not matter. Values supplied in this method\'s log/name, resource, and labels fields are copied into those log entries in this list that do not include values for their corresponding fields. For more information, see the LogEntry type.If the timestamp or insert/id fields are missing in log entries, then this method supplies the current time or a unique identifier, respectively. The supplied values are chosen so that, among the log entries that did not supply their own values, the entries earlier in the list will sort before the entries later in the list. See the entries.list method.Log entries with timestamps that are more than the logs retention period (https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/logging\/quotas) in the past or more than 24 hours in the future will not be available when calling entries.list. However, those log entries can still be exported with LogSinks
    -- (https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/logging\/docs\/api\/tasks\/exporting-logs).To improve throughput and to avoid exceeding the quota limit (https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/logging\/quotas) for calls to entries.write, you should try to include several log entries in this list, rather than calling this method for each individual log entry.
    entries :: (Core.Maybe [LogEntry]),
    -- | Optional. Default labels that are added to the labels field of all log entries in entries. If a log entry already has a label with the same key as a label in this parameter, then the log entry\'s label is not changed. See LogEntry.
    labels :: (Core.Maybe WriteLogEntriesRequest_Labels),
    -- | Optional. A default log resource name that is assigned to all log entries in entries that do not specify a value for log/name: projects\/[PROJECT/ID]\/logs\/[LOG/ID] organizations\/[ORGANIZATION/ID]\/logs\/[LOG/ID] billingAccounts\/[BILLING/ACCOUNT/ID]\/logs\/[LOG/ID] folders\/[FOLDER_ID]\/logs\/[LOG_ID][LOG_ID] must be URL-encoded. For example: \"projects\/my-project-id\/logs\/syslog\" \"organizations\/123\/logs\/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity\" The permission logging.logEntries.create is needed on each project, organization, billing account, or folder that is receiving new log entries, whether the resource is specified in logName or in an individual log entry.
    logName :: (Core.Maybe Core.Text),
    -- | Optional. Whether a batch\'s valid entries should be written even if some other entry failed due to a permanent error such as INVALID/ARGUMENT or PERMISSION/DENIED. If any entry failed, then the response status is the response status of one of the failed entries. The response will include error details in WriteLogEntriesPartialErrors.log/entry/errors keyed by the entries\' zero-based index in the entries. Failed requests for which no entries are written will not include per-entry errors.
    partialSuccess :: (Core.Maybe Core.Bool),
    -- | Optional. A default monitored resource object that is assigned to all log entries in entries that do not specify a value for resource. Example: { \"type\": \"gce/instance\", \"labels\": { \"zone\": \"us-central1-a\", \"instance/id\": \"00000000000000000000\" }} See LogEntry.
