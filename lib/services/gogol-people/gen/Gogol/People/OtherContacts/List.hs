-- List all \"Other contacts\", that is contacts that are not in a contact group. \"Other contacts\" are typically auto created contacts from interactions. Sync tokens expire 7 days after the full sync. A request with an expired sync token will result in a 410 error. In the case of such an error clients should make a full sync request without a @sync_token@. The first page of a full sync request has an additional quota. If the quota is exceeded, a 429 error will be returned. This quota is fixed and can not be increased. When the @sync_token@ is specified, resources deleted since the last sync will be returned as a person with @PersonMetadata.deleted@ set to true. When the @page_token@ or @sync_token@ is specified, all other request parameters must match the first call. Writes may have a propagation delay of several minutes for sync requests. Incremental syncs are not intended for read-after-write use cases. See example usage at

    -- | Required. A field mask to restrict which fields on each person are returned. Multiple fields can be specified by separating them with commas. What values are valid depend on what ReadSourceType is used. If READ/SOURCE/TYPE/CONTACT is used, valid values are: * emailAddresses * metadata * names * phoneNumbers * photos If READ/SOURCE/TYPE/PROFILE is used, valid values are: * addresses * ageRanges * biographies * birthdays * calendarUrls * clientData * coverPhotos * emailAddresses * events * externalIds * genders * imClients * interests * locales * locations * memberships * metadata * miscKeywords * names * nicknames * occupations * organizations * phoneNumbers * photos * relations * sipAddresses * skills * urls * userDefined
