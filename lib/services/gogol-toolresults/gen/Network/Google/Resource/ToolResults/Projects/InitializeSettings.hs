-- Creates resources for settings which have not yet been set. Currently,
-- this creates a single resource: a Google Cloud Storage bucket, to be
-- used as the default bucket for this project. The bucket is created in an
-- FTL-own storage project. Except for in rare cases, calling this method
-- in parallel from multiple clients will only create a single bucket. In
-- order to avoid unnecessary storage charges, the bucket is configured to
-- automatically delete objects older than 90 days. The bucket is created
-- with the following permissions: - Owner access for owners of central
-- storage project (FTL-owned) - Writer access for owners\/editors of
-- customer project - Reader access for viewers of customer project The
-- default ACL on objects created in the bucket is: - Owner access for
-- owners of central storage project - Reader access for
-- owners\/editors\/viewers of customer project See Google Cloud Storage
-- documentation for more details. If there is already a default bucket set
-- and the project can access the bucket, this call does nothing. However,
-- if the project doesn\'t have the permission to access the bucket or the
-- bucket is deleted, a new bucket will be created. May return any
-- canonical error codes, including the following: - PERMISSION_DENIED - if
-- the user is not authorized to write to project - Any error code raised
-- by Google Cloud Storage
